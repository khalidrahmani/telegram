TELEGRAM

 first if there is a way to add contacts to telegram automatically, 
 for example from an excel file or google sheet, and then to send them all a message, 

We need to have different contact groups so we can send them different messages, so what we want is to select an excel sheet and send a message to that one
I will first start by adding contact from sheet, and sending them a message, after that, we can easily update the script to manage different groups and messages.
